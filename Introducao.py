	logos with trademarked logos,
	pathos with data,
	ethos with unequivocal logic -
	perfect, objective, unilateral,
	just like the souls of those who build the day of tomorrow
	by perpetuating spectacles
	through new obsolete gadgets.
	but
	where does touching dwell?
	where does simplicity dwell? and slowness? what about poetry?
	where does what sweats and cries and shits and makes love and feels pain dwell?""")
